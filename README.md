# Udacity FEND Nanodegree Project 5 - Restaurant Reviews
This is the 5th project in the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. We were given code for a restaurant reviews website which had lots of issues and was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. We were required to improve the code, add responsiveness, add accessibility features, and add a service work to allow for an offline first experience.

## Getting Started
Open the index page in your browser. You will be able to navigate between the main index page which shows the various restaurants and a detail page for each.

## Prerequisites
In development mode a local HTTP server needs to be used. (Python v3 was used for this project) This project uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). A token from Mapbox was required to access the maps.

## Built With
